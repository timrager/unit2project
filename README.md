   * Synopsis of episode or series
   * Number of episodes
   * Season episode or series was aired
   * Person rating of episode or series (from 1 - 5)

## Approach Taken
As anime tends to be a very visual form of media, I wanted to utlize Materialize's cards as a way to visually lay out and display series.

Each series has options to either get more information about the series, edit the series, add episodes, or delete the series from the page. 

On each page for a particular series is more detailed information such as number of episodes, rating, etc., but also additional cards of related episodes.
